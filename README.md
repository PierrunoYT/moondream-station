### How It Works

üöÄ **Launches Local Server**  
   All inference runs on your device

üîß **Control via CLI**  
   Caption images, answer questions, and manage settings

üåê **Access via HTTP**  
   Connect to `http://localhost:2020/v1` through REST or our [Python](https://pypi.org/project/moondream/), [Node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moondream), or [OpenAI](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) client

## Installation

Install from PyPI:
```bash
pip install moondream-station
```

Install from source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/m87-labs/moondream-station.git
cd moondream-station
pip install -e .
```
That's it! Moondream Station will automatically set itself up.

## Usage

### Launch Moondream Station

To fire up Moondream Station, execute this command in your terminal:
```
$ moondream-station
```

### Model Management
By default, Moondream Station uses the latest model your machine supports. If you want to view or activate other Moondream models, use the following commands:
- `models` - List available models
- `models switch <model>` - Switch to a model

### Service Control
We like to think Moondream has 20/20 vision; that‚Äôs why we launch Moondream Station on port 2020. If that port is taken, Moondream Station will try to use nearby port that is free. Additionally, you can control the port and the status of the inference service with the following commands:
- `start [port]` - Start REST server (default: port 2020)
- `stop` - Stop server
- `restart` - Restart server

### Inference
**Access via HTTP**: 
Point any of our inference clients at your Moondream Station; for example, with our python client you can do:

```python
import moondream as md
from PIL import Image

# connect to Moondream Station
model = md.vl(endpoint="http://localhost:2020/v1")

# Load an image
image = Image.open("path/to/image.jpg")

# Ask a question
answer = model.query(image, "What's in this image?")["answer"]
print("Answer:", answer)
```
For more information on our clients visit: [Python](https://pypi.org/project/moondream/), [Node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moondream), [Quick Start](https://moondream.ai/c/docs/quickstart)

**Connect via CLI**: 
Use all the capabilities of Moondream directly through your terminal. No need to touch any code!

- `infer <function> [args]` - Run single inference
- `inference` - Enter interactive inference mode

### Settings
Control the number of workers, queue size, privacy settings, and more through Settings:

- `settings` - Show configuration
- `settings set <key> <value>` - Set setting value

Moondream Station collects anonymous usage metrics to help us improve the app. The following data is collected:

- **Event data**: When you use features like caption, query, detect, or point
- **Version information**: Active bootstrap, hypervisor, inference client, and model version
- **System information**: OS version, IP address, and Python version/runtime

No personal information, image, or prompt/response is ever collected. To opt-out of logging run: `settings set logging false`.

### Utility
The utility functinos provide insite into what Moondream Station is currently doing. To view statistics for your current session, use the `session` mode. To view a log of requests processed by Moondream Station, use the `history` command.
